# ToomreQ

This repository contains the code I used to obtain results for my paper (in prep) titled 'WISDOM Project - XXVII. Evaluating the Role of the Toomre ùëÑ
Parameter in the Stability of the Cold Gaseous Discs of Early-type Galaxies'. TThe code is used for astronomical data analysis and visualization related to the galaxy NGC 0524, but can easily be applied to each of the seven NGC galaxies analysed in the paper. The code performs calculations to determine the stability of the galaxy's gas and stellar disks using the Toomre Q parameter.

Many elliptical galaxies are rich in cold molecular gas, yet quiescent, quiescent to the extent that they are referred to as 'red and dead' galaxies . This is an intriguing phenomenon because galaxies rich in cold molecular gas are in priciple the ideal environment for star formation to occur. So thanks to high angular resolution CO line data obtained with the Atacama Large Millime-ter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and modelling of the stellar mass distributions with multi-Gaussian expansion models, we study the large-scale cold molecular gas disc dynamics and stability of seven early-type galaxies (ETGs), via the Toomre ùëÑ (ùëÑ_T) parameter; and we demonstrate that indeed the large-scale gaseous dynamics are crucial for the quiescent nature of these galaxies.


**Functions_For_Q_NGC0524.py** - In this file, key parameters are calculated and plotted for determining the stability of the galaxy's gas and stellar disks, specifically using the Toomre Q parameter. The script contains functions for opening and processing FITS astronomical data files, generating masks to filter out noise, and creating spectral cubes. A major part of the code is dedicated to creating and plotting various moment maps (moment 0, 1, and 2) to visualize the integrated intensity, velocity, and velocity dispersion of the CO gas. Additionally, it includes functions for converting coordinates, calculating the deprojected galactocentric radius, and determining the circular velocity using a Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) model, which we then use to derive the epicyclic frequency (kappa), a critical component for the disk stability analysis. Additionally we model the stellar surface density and stellar velocity dispersion. With this, we can calculate all the parameters required to calculate a spaxel-by-spaxel view of Toomre Q in the gaseous disks in our sample of galaxies.


**Call_Functions_for_Q_NGC0524.py** -  This is the main script that uses the functions from Functions_For_Q_NGC0524.py. It sets up the necessary variables and calls the functions to perform the analysis. It serves as an example of how to run the code.

The file contains variables for:

File names: Specifies the FITS files for the galaxy data and moment maps.

Galaxy properties: Defines the celestial coordinates, distance, and inclination of the galaxy NGC 0524, which are used as inputs for the functions.

This script imports all the necessary functions from Functions_For_Q_NGC0524.py and then defines the parameters for the analysis. It is the control script for executing the code.
